We present a novel approach to the automatic acquisition of taxonomies or concept hierarchies from a text corpus The approach is based on Formal Concept Analysis  a method mainly used for the analysis of data ie for investigating and processing explicitly given information We follow Harris distributional hypothesis and model the context of a certain term as a vector repre senting syntactic dependencies which are automatically acquired from the text corpus with a lin guistic parser On the basis of this context information FCA produces a lattice that we convert into a special kind of partial order constituting a concept hierarchy The approach is evaluated by com paring the resulting concept hierarchies with handcrafted taxonomies for two domains tourism and ﬁnance We also directly compare our approach with hierarchical agglomerative clustering as well as with BiSectionKMeans as an instance of a divisive clustering algorithm However it is also well known that any knowledgebased system suffers from the socalled knowledge acquisition bottleneck ie the difﬁculty to actually model the domain in question In c 2005 AI Access Foundation All rights reserved CIMIANO HOTHO  STAAB order to partially overcome this problem we present a novel approach to automatically learning a concept hierarchy from a text corpus Making the knowledge implicitly contained in texts explicit is a great challenge For example Brewster Ciravegna and Wilks  have argued that text writing and reading is in fact a process of background knowledge maintenance in the sense that basic domain knowledge is assumed and only the relevant part of knowledge which is the issue of the text or article is mentioned in a more or less explicit way Actually knowledge can be found in texts at different levels of explicitness depending on the sort of text considered Handbooks textbooks or dictionaries for example contain explicit knowledge in form of deﬁnitions such as a tiger is a mammal or mammals such as tigers lions or elephants In fact some researchers have exploited such regular patterns to discover taxonomic or partof relations in texts In fact different methods have been proposed in the literature to address the problem of semi automatically deriving a concept hierarchy from text based on the distributional hypothesis Basi cally these methods can be grouped into two classes the similaritybased methods on the one hand and the settheoretical on the other hand Both methods adopt a vectorspace model and represent a word or term as a vector containing features or attributes derived from a certain corpus There is certainly a great divergence in which attributes are used for this purpose but typically some sort of syntactic features are used such as conjunctions appositions  or verbargument dependencies Hindle 1990 Pereira Tishby  Lee 1993 Grefenstette 1994 Faure  Nedellec 1998 The ﬁrst type of methods is characterized by the use of a similarity or distance measure in order to compute the pairwise similarity or distance between vectors corresponding to two words or terms in order to decide if they can be clustered or not Some prominent examples for this type of method have been developed by Hindle  Pereira et al  Grefenstette  Faure and Nedellec  Caraballo  as well as Bisson Nedellec and Canamero  Set theoretical approaches partially order the objects according to the inclusion relations between their attribute sets  In this paper we present an approach based on Formal Concept Analysis a method based on order theory and mainly used for the analysis of data in particular for discovering inherent rela tionships between objects described through a set of attributes on the one hand and the attributes themselves on the other In order to derive attributes from a certain corpus we parse it and extract verbprepositional phrase complement verbobject and verbsubject dependencies For each noun appearing as head of these argument positions we then use the corre sponding verbs as attributes for building the formal context and then calculating the formal concept lattice on its basis Though different methods have been explored in the literature there is actually a lack of compar ative work concerning the task of automatically learning concept hierarchies with clustering tech niques However as argued by Cimiano Hotho and Staab  ontology engineers need guide lines about the effectiveness efﬁciency and tradeoffs of different methods in order to decide which techniques to apply in which settings Thus we present a comparison along these lines between our 306
