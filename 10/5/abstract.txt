This pap er studies the problem of learning diagnostic p olicies from training examples A diagnostic p olicy is a complete description of the decisionmaking actions of a diagnostician ie tests follo w ed b y a diagnostic decision for all p ossible com binations of test results An optimal diagnostic p olicy is one that minimizes the exp ected total cost whic h is the sum of measuremen t costs and misdiagnosis costs In most diagnostic settings there is a tradeo b et w een these t w o kinds of costs This pap er formalizes diagnostic decision making as a Mark o v Decision Pro cess  The pap er in tro duces a new family of systematic searc h algorithms based on the A O  algo rithm to solv e The pap er also in tro duces sev eral greedy algorithms including some impro v emen ts o v er previouslypublished metho ds The pap er then addresses the question of learning diagnostic p olicies from examples When the probabilities of diseases and test results are computed from training data there is a great danger of o v er tting T o reduce o v er tting regularizers are in tegrated in to the searc AI Access F oundation All righ ts reserv ed Ba yerZubek  Dietterich W e can formalize this diagnostic task as follo ws Giv en a patien t the do ctor can execute a set of N p ossible measuremen ts x       x N  When measuremen t x n is executed the result is an observ ed v alue v n  F or example if x  is patien ts age then v  could b e   Eac h measuremen t x n has an asso ciated cost C  The do ctor also can c ho ose one of K diagnosis actions Diagnosis action f k diagnoses the patien t as su ering from disease k  W e will denote the correct diagnosis of the patien t b y y The misdiagnosis cost of predicting disease k when the correct diagnosis is y is denoted b y M C  The pro cess of diagnosis consists of a sequence of decisions In the starting state no measuremen ts or diagnoses ha v e b een made W e denote this b y the empt y set fg Supp ose that in this starting kno wledge state the do ctor c ho oses measuremen t x  and receiv es the result that x    at a cost of 00 No w supp ose the do ctor c ho oses x   whic h measures b o dy mass index and receiv es a result x   smal l at a cost of  This c hanges the kno wledge state to fx    x   smal l g at a cost of C x
