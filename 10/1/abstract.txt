The social photosharing site Flickr for example allows users to group related photos in sets and related sets in collec tions The social bookmarking site Delicious similarly lets users group related tags into bundles Although the sites themselves dont impose any constraints on how these hierarchies are used individuals generally use them to capture relationships between concepts most commonly the broadernarrower relations Collective annotation of content with hier archical relations may lead to an emergent classiﬁcation system called a folksonomy While some researchers have explored using tags as evidence for learning folksonomies we believe that hierarchical relations described above oﬀer a highquality source of evidence for this task We propose a simple approach to aggregate shallow hierarchies created by many distinct Flickr users into a common folksonomy Our approach uses statistics to determine if a particular relation should be retained or discarded The relations are then woven together into larger hierarchies Although we have not carried out a detailed quantitative evaluation of the approach it looks very promising since it generates very reasonable nontrivial hierarchies
