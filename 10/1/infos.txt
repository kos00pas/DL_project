Introduction: The social photosharing site Flickr for example allows users to group related photos in sets and related sets in collec tions The social bookmarking site Delicious similarly lets users group related tags into bundles Although the sites themselves dont impose any constraints on how these hierarchies are used individuals generally use them to capture relationships between concepts most commonly the broadernarrower relations Collective annotation of content with hier archical relations may lead to an emergent classiﬁcation system called a folksonomy While some researchers have explored using tags as evidence for learning folksonomies we believe that hierarchical relations described above oﬀer a highquality source of evidence for this task We propose a simple approach to aggregate shallow hierarchies created by many distinct Flickr users into a common folksonomy Our approach uses statistics to determine if a particular relation should be retained or discarded The relations are then woven together into larger hierarchies Although we have not carried out a detailed quantitative evaluation of the approach it looks very promising since it generates very reasonable nontrivial hierarchies Key words Folksonomies Taxonomies Collective Knowledge Social Information Processing Data Mining 1 Introduction The subject of automatic taxonomy creation has attracted much attention from the academic community because of its close ties to important topics in philoso phy cognitive and computer sciences and information technology A taxonomy is a classiﬁcation system that helps people organize their knowledge of the world hierarchically through broadernarrower superclasssubclass relations between concepts One of the best known taxonomies is the Linnean classiﬁcation of living organisms There are alternative classiﬁcation systems for organizing knowledge that do not rely exclusively on strict hierarchies These include faceted classi ﬁcation schemes which combine multiple taxonomies to represent objects the arXiv08053747v1 csAI 24 May 2008 2 Anon Plangprasopchok and Kristina The metadata comes in a variety of forms including tags the freelychosen keywords used to describe content as well as links users create between content metadata and other users Although users annotate content for personal use usergenerated metadata can be used to discover relevant re sources  personalize search  and automatically generate taxonomies 35 Such a bottomup taxonomy  a folksonomy  has a number of advantages over formal topdown classiﬁcation systems  it is dynamic evolving in time as communitys needs and vocabulary change  describes facets of data that are salient to users and  has a level of detail that is meaningful to users Sim ilar to a formal classiﬁcation system an automatically generated folksonomy could be used for information management and discovery as well as to annotate usergenerated content in order to make it machinereadable The current approaches to automatic folksonomy creation combine tags cre ated by large numbers of distinct individuals by looking at statistics of their occurrence Aggregating data from these users would potentially generate a shortcut from one concept to another or multiple paths between concepts Determining which path is correct is a nontrivial issue In addition to these challenges there is also the familiar challenge of keyword ambiguity where washington could mean the state or the city In this paper we propose a simple framework for aggregating shallow indi vidual hierarchies into a common folksonomy1 We use the shallow hierarchies created through the collectionset relations on Flickr Second we propose a simple statistical approach to resolve hierarchical relation conﬂicts in the aggregation process Al though we dont undertake a quantitative evaluation of the learner folksonomies they appear to be very reasonable and detailed 2 Related work
Problem and Solution: However unlike those works which merge a small number of deep and detailed hierarchies we merge large number of noisy shallow hierarchies Constructing Folksonomies from Userspeciﬁed Relations on Flickr 5 3 Hierarchical structures on the social Web In addition to ﬂat keywords or tags some social Web sites have recently began to provide a feature that enables users to hierarchically organize content with broadernarrower relations We believe that in the future many more social Web sites will allow their users to specify complex semantic relations not only tags We brieﬂy describe how this feature is implemented on Flickr and delicious Fig 1 A schematic view of how Flickr users organize their photos A dot box cover an area controlled by a user including content and metadata produced by the user A photo can be annotated with a set of tags Each photo can belong to one or more albums  each album can be in a certain superalbum  A photo can also be submitted to a public group An assignment of the photo to a group is independent to the set to which that photo belongs The social photosharing site Flickr2 allows users to group their photos in albumlike folders named photo sets Users can also group their photo sets into super albums called collections 3  shows a schematic diagram of this organization Both sets and collections are named by the owner of the images Each photo can also be submitted to any of the thousands of specialinterest groups Flickr users have created to share photos on a given topic Flickr does not enforce any speciﬁc rules about how to organize photos in sets and collections or how to name them We found that most users group similar or related photos into the same set and group related sets into the same collection as shown in  The name of the set generally subsumes 2  3 Sij is the name of Sij We assume that relations that a user speciﬁes through collections and sets are broadernarrower relations We denote that Ci is broader that Sij as Ci Sij These relations are also applicable to their constituent terms relation delega tion In particular if a user speciﬁes the set Sij under the collection Ci  the former is narrower than the latter and all the terms in Sij are also narrower than those of Ci We also assume that each of those terms represents a concept in a conceptual hierarchy and that the same terms used by the same or diﬀerent users represent the same concept6 41 Approach From the problem deﬁnition above we follow three main steps in aggregating relations  term extraction and normalization  relation conﬂict resolution  concept prunning and linking The ﬁrst step is necessary because of variations in the names associated with the same concept eg capitalization and punc tuation The number of concepts is reduced from 94 499 to 3 239 and 3 244 concepts for hard and soft constraint respec tively Top 200 concepts with high Rxoi are discarded The resulting graph of interlinked concepts is quite complex To simplify browsing we extract subgraphs associated with a concept Starting with a given concept we get its parents  and then follow the outgoing links on the graph to get the children  and the childrens children etc We illustrate the results with some sample graphs We colored the graphs to aid visualization The starting concept is in yellow its parent concepts  are in pink while the direct descendants are in green The rest of the descendants are in blue The graph in  shows the concept graph for the  country It has 32 children  including france china india uk etc Of the 32 children only two florida and paris are not proper countries The concepts in blue are the children of the individual countries In general these automatically discovered concepts are quite good For example russia has narrower concepts moscow st petersburg and hermitage while england has warwick stonehenge and lake district among others While geographical names provide a common vocabulary for labeling and organizing travel photographs there is suﬃcient vocabulary agreement to in duce concept graphs in many other domains  shows the graphs associ ated with  invertebrate and  vehicl We present two more concept graphs to illustrate our methods ability to discover many relevant subcategories  shows the graph associated with the concept vertebrate which includes bird and many concepts corresponding to speciﬁc types of birds Similarly sport graph shows many speciﬁc types of sports Our algorithm associated france with sport maybe because of the popular tour de france However all other discovered subsumption relations are correct 10 Anon Plangprasopchok and Kristina Lerman Fig 3 Folksonomy associated with the concept country showing its broader and narrower concepts We colored the graph to aid visualization The starting concept is in yellow its parent concepts  are in pink while the direct descendants are in green The rest of the descendants are in blue Constructing Folksonomies from Userspeciﬁed Relations on Flickr 11
Conclusion: The social Web sites allow users to contribute content and also provide tools to help them manage content by annotating it with descriptive tags and more recently with semantic relations By making large amount of such metadata available social Web sites enable researchers to empirically study how humans organize knowledge and also to learn a common classiﬁcation system a folkson omy from the data This paper describes a statistical approach to aggregating large number of simple broadernarrower relations speciﬁed by diﬀerent users into a common deeper folksonomy The broadernarrow relations we used for Constructing Folksonomies from Userspeciﬁed Relations on Flickr 13 Fig 6 Concept graph associated with the concept invertebrate showing its broader and related narrower concepts the study were expressed through the shallow hierarchies of photo sets and col lections created by Flickr users to manage their photos Our approach is general and can be applied to other systems that allow users to specify relations eg the social bookmarking site Delicious allows users to group related tags into tag bundles Our longterm goal is to learn the structure of collective knowledge from the evidence provided by many users  We believe that the simple relations described above are more informative than tags alone for learning how people classify things Although we have not quantitatively compared the folksonomy learned by our approach to existing classiﬁcation systems qualitative evaluation indicates that our baseline method already yields good quality folksonomies There is still much room for improvement In the future we plan to separate broadernarrower from relatedto relations We also need to more system atically handle the challenges of diﬀerent users using a diﬀerent classiﬁcation order and diﬀerent level of speciﬁcity in the relations they specify We would also like to combine relations with tag statistics to disambiguate concepts We would also like to perform a systematic evaluation of the learned folksonomies eg by comparing learned structures to ODPs dmoz the open Web directory 14 Anon Plangprasopchok and Kristina Lerman Acknowledgements We would like to thank Fetch Technologies for providing us with a Web page scraping tool We also appreciate yWorks for providing yEd freely available for visualizing concept relations
