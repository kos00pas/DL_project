This paper describes application of information granulation theory on the design of rock engineering flowcharts Firstly an overall flowchart based on information granulation theory has been highlighted Information granulation theory in crisp nonfuzzy or fuzzy format can take into account engineering experiences especially in fuzzy shapeincomplete information or superfluous or engineering judgments in each step of designing procedure while the suitable instruments modeling are employed In this manner and to extension of soft modeling instruments using three combinations of Self Organizing Map  NeuroFuzzy Inference System  and Rough Set Theory  crisp and fuzzy granules from monitored data sets are obtained The main underlined core of our algorithms are balancing of crisprough or nonfuzzy granules and sub fuzzy granules within non fuzzy information  upon the openclose iterations Using different criteria on balancing best granules  are obtained Validations of our proposed methods on the data set of insitu permeability in rock masses in Shivashan dam Iran have been highlighted general network are affected from the several parameters concluded in granulation level factor In this paper we interest to tack in to account soft granulation in rock system Upon this by focusing in two categories C1 and C2 in figure1 we develop different soft granulation methods based on intelligent systems and approximate reasoning methods Added to this the bridging between hard and soft granulation is abstracted The most main distinguished facets of the soft granules are set theory interval analysis fuzzy set rough set Each of these theories considers part of uncertainty of information data words pictures Due to association of uncertainty and vagueness with the monitored data set particularly resulted from the insitu tests  accounting relevant approaches such probability Fuzzy Set Theory  and Rough Set Theory  to knowledge acquisition extraction of rules and prediction of unknown cases more than the past have been distinguished Zadeh has emphasized the role of FST in geosciences will be increased during future years  The RST introduced by Pawlak has often proved to be an excellent mathematical tool for the analysis of a vague description of object   The adjective vague referring to the quality of information means inconsistency or ambiguity which follows from information granulation Precise condition rules can be extracted from a discernibility matrix Application of RST in different fields of the applied sciences has been reported   but developing of such system  in rock engineering have not been outstanding relatively  shows a general procedure in which the IGT accompanies by a predefined project based rock engineering design After determination of constraints and the associated rock engineering considerations the initial granulation of information as well as numerical  or in linguistic formats is accomplished Improvement of modeling instruments based upon IGs whether in independent or affiliated shape with hard computing methods such fuzzy finite element fuzzy boundary element stochastic finite element are new challenges in the current discussion In this study under modeling instruments box we propose three algorithms namely successive elicitation of crisp nonfuzzy fuzzy and rough granulations Self Organizing NeuroFuzzy Inference System  in an abbreviated manner SONFISR SONFISAR and Self Organizing Rough Set Theory  Fig1 one of the last general flowcharts to rock engineering design In figure 3 we have concluded a summary of current overall granulation in a rock project that leads to the formation of fuzzy granules on the attributes  of joints  show how one usually employs granulation procedure to permeability analysis in a dam site instinctively The rest of paper has been organized as section 2 preliminaries on some soft granulation methods ie SOM NFIS and RST in next section we propose three main algorithms and part 4 covers a practical instance describes how the soft granules ensue a relatively complete analysis on the permeability of Shivashan dam site in Iran 2 PRELIMINARIES 21
