Introduction: 1 INTROUDCTION In the recent years developing new indirect analysis methods has opened new horizons in rock engineering solutions Tendency to the microview of the natural events in the rock based systems upon the high speed PC technology behind large scale investigations has allocated new challenges in this track Transition from a general  view in to the detailed descriptions can be interpreted as relations interextra relations of the commuted information packages got from accumulations of data experience novelty and other effective agents Such construction of the whole from part  is the current behavior of human cognition Among the basic concepts which underlie human cognition there are three remarkable sides which are granulation organization and causation Granulation involves decomposition of whole into parts organization involves integration of parts in to whole and causation relates to association of causes with effects  Under this view from the discritization meshing blocking latticing of the interior or boundary of a field to the solving steps  of the problem are the perspectives of granulation We called first level of granulation as hard granulation and second level as soft granulation To better understand of the meaning of hard and soft granulation we reproduce the general rock engineering design flowchart in figure1  Level1 can be supposed as a hard granulation where level2 is related with soft granulation Clearly in soft granulation we are approaching to the real human cognition whereas in hard packing the machine computations are distinguished Let us consider the last class in level2  internet based system Interestingly this category shows how the discriminated projects under the virtual world employ the distributed information granules Plainly the contributions of any projects and the subsets of granules in construction of this Rock mechanics modeling based on soft granulation theory H Owladeghaffari Dept Mining Metallurgical Engineering Amirkabir University of Technology Tehran Iran ABSTRACT This paper describes application of information granulation theory on the design of rock engineering flowcharts Firstly an overall flowchart based on information granulation theory has been highlighted Information granulation theory in crisp nonfuzzy or fuzzy format can take into account engineering experiences especially in fuzzy shapeincomplete information or superfluous or engineering judgments in each step of designing procedure while the suitable instruments modeling are employed In this manner and to extension of soft modeling instruments using three combinations of Self Organizing Map  NeuroFuzzy Inference System  and Rough Set Theory  crisp and fuzzy granules from monitored data sets are obtained The main underlined core of our algorithms are balancing of crisprough or nonfuzzy granules and sub fuzzy granules within non fuzzy information  upon the openclose iterations Using different criteria on balancing best granules  are obtained Validations of our proposed methods on the data set of insitu permeability in rock masses in Shivashan dam Iran have been highlighted general network are affected from the several parameters concluded in granulation level factor In this paper we interest to tack in to account soft granulation in rock system Upon this by focusing in two categories C1 and C2 in figure1 we develop different soft granulation methods based on intelligent systems and approximate reasoning methods Added to this the bridging between hard and soft granulation is abstracted The most main distinguished facets of the soft granules are set theory interval analysis fuzzy set rough set Each of these theories considers part of uncertainty of information data words pictures Due to association of uncertainty and vagueness with the monitored data set particularly resulted from the insitu tests  accounting relevant approaches such probability Fuzzy Set Theory  and Rough Set Theory  to knowledge acquisition extraction of rules and prediction of unknown cases more than the past have been distinguished Zadeh has emphasized the role of FST in geosciences will be increased during future years  The RST introduced by Pawlak has often proved to be an excellent mathematical tool for the analysis of a vague description of object   The adjective vague referring to the quality of information means inconsistency or ambiguity which follows from information granulation Precise condition rules can be extracted from a discernibility matrix Application of RST in different fields of the applied sciences has been reported   but developing of such system  in rock engineering have not been outstanding relatively  shows a general procedure in which the IGT accompanies by a predefined project based rock engineering design After determination of constraints and the associated rock engineering considerations the initial granulation of information as well as numerical  or in linguistic formats is accomplished Improvement of modeling instruments based upon IGs whether in independent or affiliated shape with hard computing methods such fuzzy finite element fuzzy boundary element stochastic finite element are new challenges in the current discussion In this study under modeling instruments box we propose three algorithms namely successive elicitation of crisp nonfuzzy fuzzy and rough granulations Self Organizing NeuroFuzzy Inference System  in an abbreviated manner SONFISR SONFISAR and Self Organizing Rough Set Theory  Fig1 one of the last general flowcharts to rock engineering design In figure 3 we have concluded a summary of current overall granulation in a rock project that leads to the formation of fuzzy granules on the attributes  of joints  show how one usually employs granulation procedure to permeability analysis in a dam site instinctively The rest of paper has been organized as section 2 preliminaries on some soft granulation methods ie SOM NFIS and RST in next section we propose three main algorithms and part 4 covers a practical instance describes how the soft granules ensue a relatively complete analysis on the permeability of Shivashan dam site in Iran 2 PRELIMINARIES 21 Kohonen self organizing networks Kohonen feature maps or topologypreserving maps are competitionbased network paradigm for data clustering The learning procedure of Kohonen feature maps is similar to the competitive learning networks The main idea behind competitive learning is simple the winner takes all The competitive transfer function returns neural outputs of 0 for all neurons except for the winner which receives the highest net input with output 1 SOM changes all weight vectors of neurons in the near vicinity of the winner neuron towards the input vector Due to this property SOM are used to reduce the dimensionality of complex data  Competitive layers will automatically learn to classify input vectors the classes that the competitive layer finds are depend only on the distances between input vectors  Fig2 A general methodology for back analysis based on IGT 22 Neurofuzzy inference system  There are different solutions of fuzzy inference systems Two wellknown fuzzy modeling methods are the Tsukamoto fuzzy model and Takagi SugenoKang  model In the present work only the TSK model has been considered The TSK fuzzy inference systems can be easily implanted in the form of a so called Neurofuzzy network structure in this study we have employed an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system  Fig3 Current overall granulation in a rock project Fig4 Granulation procedure to permeability analysis in a dam site One of the most important stages of the Neuro fuzzy TSK network generation is the establishment of the inference rules Often used is the socalled grid method in which the rules are defined as the combinations of the membership functions for each input variable If we split the input variable range into a limited number say ni for i1 2 n of membership functions the combinations of them lead to many different inference rules The problem is that these combinations correspond in many cases to the regions of no data and hence a lot of them may be deleted This problem can be solved by using the fuzzy selforganization
Problem and Solution: in the current discussion In this study under modeling instruments box we propose three algorithms namely successive elicitation of crisp nonfuzzy fuzzy and rough granulations Self Organizing NeuroFuzzy Inference System  in an abbreviated manner SONFISR SONFISAR and Self Organizing Rough Set Theory  Fig1 one of the last general flowcharts to rock engineering design In figure 3 we have concluded a summary of current overall granulation in a rock project that leads to the formation of fuzzy granules on the attributes  of joints  show how one usually employs granulation procedure to permeability analysis in a dam site instinctively The rest of paper has been organized as section 2 preliminaries on some soft granulation methods ie SOM NFIS and RST in next section we propose three main algorithms and part 4 covers a practical instance describes how the soft granules ensue a relatively complete analysis on the permeability of Shivashan dam site in Iran 2 PRELIMINARIES 21 Kohonen self organizing networks Kohonen feature maps or topologypreserving maps are competitionbased network paradigm for data clustering The learning procedure of Kohonen feature maps is similar to the competitive learning networks The main idea behind competitive learning is simple the winner takes all The competitive transfer function returns neural outputs of 0 for all neurons except for the winner which receives the highest net input with output 1 SOM changes all weight vectors of neurons in the near vicinity of the winner neuron towards the input vector Due to this property SOM are used to reduce the dimensionality of complex data  Competitive layers will automatically learn to classify input vectors the classes that the competitive layer finds are depend only on the distances between input vectors  Fig2 A general methodology for back analysis based on IGT 22 Neurofuzzy inference system  There are different solutions of fuzzy inference systems Two wellknown fuzzy modeling methods are the Tsukamoto fuzzy model and Takagi SugenoKang  model In the present work only the TSK model has been considered The TSK fuzzy inference systems can be easily implanted in the form of a so called Neurofuzzy network structure in this study we have employed an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system  Fig3 Current overall granulation in a rock project Fig4 Granulation procedure to permeability analysis in a dam site One of the most important stages of the Neuro fuzzy TSK network generation is the establishment of the inference rules Often used is the socalled grid method in which the rules are defined as the combinations of the membership functions for each input variable If we split the input variable range into a limited number say ni for i1 2 n of membership functions the combinations of them lead to many different inference rules The problem is that these combinations correspond in many cases to the regions of no data and hence a lot of them may be deleted This problem can be solved by using the fuzzy selforganization algorithm This algorithm splits the data space into a specified number of overlapping clusters Each cluster may be associated with the specific rule of the center corresponding to the center of the appropriate cluster In this way all rules correspond to the regions of the spacecontaining majority of data and the problem of the empty rules can be avoided The ultimate goal of data clustering is to partition the data into similar subgroups This is accomplished by employing some similar measures eg the Euclidean distance In this paper data clustering is used to derive membership functions from measured data which in turn determine the number of IfThen rules in the model ie rules indication The method employed in this paper is the subtractive clustering method proposed by Yager as one of the simplest clustering methods  23 Rough Set Theory
Conclusion: We have explained application of SORST in back analysis in other study  Fig9  SONFISR results with maximum number of rules is 4 and closeopen iterations is 10 c Answer of selected SONFISR on the test data Now we investigate direct application of RST and NFIS on the local coordinates of dam site  and lugeon values  to depict 3D Isosurfaces of lugeon variations diagrams Fig10  SONFISR results with maximum number of rules 4 and closeopen iterations 20c d SONFISR with 5 to 8 rules number variation and 10 closeopen iterations e Answer of selected SONFISR based on nr5 on the test data  shows the variation of the lugeon data in Z 1 to 5 which has been acquired by serving five condition attributes in RST figure 16 the symbolic values by 1D SOM 5 neurons The categories 1 to 5 state very low low medium high and very high respectively Number 6  characterizes ambiguity and unknown cases Fig11SONFISAR neuron growth  error fluctuations vs iteration 101 α  a number of rules nr 2 b nr3and c nr4 Fig12 SONFISAR neuron growth  error fluctuations vs iteration 8 α   number of rules 2a RMSEiteration b neuron growthiteration c RMSE neuron fluctuation congestion of points can be used as a balance hole  Matrix plot of crisp granules by 79 grid topology SOM after 500 epochs on the training data set Fig 14 Results of transferring attribute Z L RQD TWR and lugeon in three categories  by 1D SOM Fig15 SORSTR results on the lugeon data set a strength factor b error measure variations along strength factor updating and c 3D column perspective of error measure neuron changes  Rules on N26 selected among 696 objects by SORSTR To clarify of permeability changes in consequent part of rules the lower value on the symbolic lugeon values which have relatively similar category for example 123 or 23 or 345 have been considered With serving NFIS on such attributesX Y Z lugeon without scaling permeability variations in figures 18 has been portrayed In this step three MFs  for input parameters have been utilized In Consequent of comparison between the results of RST and NFIS one may interprets the variations in z 2 is the superposition of sub levels involved z1160 to 1200 by NFIS approximately So the compatibility of the results derived from RST and NFIS can be probed by comparison of figurs1718 The forecasted domainsdark colors in figure17 by RST have been coincided by same regions in figure 18 closely It must be noticed that the RST model hasnt covered the high permeability zones because of employing conservative way in estimation of decision part whereas the NFIS has exposed such possible territories The rate of lugeon variations or density of permeable parts distinguishes the zones with capability of possible spring or hole Such cavities in the dam structures discussed as karsts which are the main characteristics of the limestone deposits  To find out the correlation between effective parameters and procuring of valid patterns of the rock mass in the dam site one may employ the similar process of NFIS or RST to estimate alterations of RQD and TWR  The contrary outputs in some zones with general contextual associated rules about RQD and lugeon implicate to the relatively complex structures aboard the rock mass Apart from a few details comparison of results indicates three overall zones in the rock mass in first zone the theoretic rules such reverse relate 1 z  2  Dec  1 2 l in 2 3  rqd  2  Dec  1 3 z  3  l  2  rqd  1 Dec  3 4 l  2  twr  3  Dec  3 5 z  3  l  1  Dec  1 OR Dec  3 6 l in 1 2  twr  2  Dec  2 7 rqd  2  twr  3  Dec  2 OR Dec  3 8 z  1  rqd  1  Dec  2 c between RQD lugeon are satisfied but in other zones the said rule is disregarded  Results of transferring attributes in five categories by 1D SOM To finding out of the background on these major zones we refer to the clustered data set by 2D SOM with 79 weights in competitive layer figure 10c on the first set of the attributes The clustered and graphical estimation disclose suitable coordination relatively For example in figure 13b we have highlighted three distinctive patterns among lugeon and Z RQD TWR
