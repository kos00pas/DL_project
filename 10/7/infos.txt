Introduction: Th us in the constrain t satisfaction comm unit y v ariable elimination is often disregarded In this pap er w e consider the c hallenging problem of nding stil llifes whic h are stable patterns of maxim um densit y in the game of life This academic problem has b een recen tly included in the CSPlib rep ository  and a dedicated w eb page  has b een set to main tain uptodate results In Bosc h and T ric k 00 None of them could solv e up to the n   problem within reasonable time Their b est results w ere obtained with a h ybrid approac h whic h com bines the t w o tec hniques and exploits the problem symmetries in order to reduce the searc h space With their algorithm the problem with plain BE In Section  w e in tro duce the h ybrid algorithm with whic h w e obtained the results rep orted in Section In Section  w e discuss ho w the ideas explored in this article can b e extended to other domains Besides w e rep ort additional exp erimen tal results Finally  Section  giv es some conclusions and lines of future w ork  Preliminaries In this Section w e rst de ne the stilllife problem Next w e de ne the w eigh ted CSP framew ork and form ulate the stilllife as a w eigh ted CSP  Finally  w e review the main solving tec hniques for w eigh ted CSPS  Life and StillLife The ob jectiv e function is the sum of all functions in F  F  X f F f and the goal is to nd the instan tiation of v ariables that minimizes the ob jectiv e function Example  Consider a WCSP with

Conclusion: s In this pap er w e ha v e studied the applicabilit y of v ariable elimination to the problem of nding stil llifes Finding stilllifes is a c hallenging problem and dev eloping new solving tec hniques is an in teresting task p er se Th us the rst con tribution of this pap er is the observ ation that plain v ariable elimination ie BE is comp etitiv e in practice and pro vides time complexit y exp onen tially b etter than searc hbased approac hes Besides w e ha v e de v elop ed an algorithm with whic h w e ha v e b een able to solv e up to the n  0 instance with whic h w e clearly impro v ed previous results Figure  Exp erimen tal results in some W CSP instances with four di eren t algorithms Eac h column rep orts CPU time in seconds Sym b ol  indicates that a time limit of 00 seconds has b een reac hed the results presen ted in this pap er add new evidence of their p oten tial W e ha v e also sho wn that v ariable elimination can b e used b ey ond the academic stilllife problem b y pro viding exp erimen tal results in some unstructured realistic problems from di eren t domains Ac kno wledgmen ts The authors are grateful to Barbara Smith Neil Y ork eSmith and the anon ymous review ers for their useful commen ts at di eren t stages of the w ork rep orted in this article Marti Sanc hez kindly made the plots in Figure  This researc
