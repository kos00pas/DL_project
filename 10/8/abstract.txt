Stochastic processes that involve the creation of objects and relations over time are widespread but relatively poorly studied For example accurate fault diagnosis in factory assembly processes requires inferring the probabilities of erroneous assembly operations but doing this efﬁciently and accurately is difﬁcult Modeled as dynamic Bayesian networks these processes have discrete vari ables with very large domains and extremely high dimensionality In this paper we introduce relational dynamic Bayesian networks  which are an extension of dynamic Bayesian net works  to ﬁrstorder logic RDBNs are a generalization of dynamic probabilistic relational models  which we had proposed in our previous work to model dynamic uncertain do mains We ﬁrst extend the RaoBlackwellised particle ﬁltering described in our earlier work to RDBNs Experiments show these two methods greatly outperform standard particle ﬁltering on the task of assembly plan execution monitoring 1 Introduction Sequential phenomena abound in the world and uncertainty is a common feature of them Dynamic Bayesian networks  one of the most powerful representations available for such phenomena represent the state of the world as a set of variables and model the probabilistic dependencies of the variables within and between time steps  While a major advance over previous approaches DBNs are essentially propositional with no notion of objects or relations hence DBNs are unable to compactly represent many realworld domains For example manu facturing plants assemble complex artifacts eg cars computers aircraft from large numbers of component parts using multiple kinds of machines and operations Capturing such a domain in a DBN would require exhaustively representing all possible objects and relations among them which is impractical Formalisms that can represent objects and relations as opposed to just variables have a long history in AI Recently signiﬁcant progress has been made in combining them with a principled treatment of uncertainty In particular probabilistic relational models or PRMs  are an extension of Bayesian networks that allows reasoning with classes objects and relations Recently we proposed dynamic probabilistic relational models   which combine PRMs and DBNs to allow reasoning with classes objects and relations in a dynamic environment We also developed a relational Rao Blackwellized particle ﬁltering mechanism for state monitoring in DPRMs c2005 AI Access Foundation In this paper we introduce relational dynamic Bayesian networks  which extend DBNs to ﬁrstorder  domains RDBNs subsume DPRMs and have several advantages over them including greater simplicity and expressivity
