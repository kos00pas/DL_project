Most exact algorithms for general par tially observable Markov decision processes  use a form of dynamic program ming in which a piecewiselinear and con vex representation of one value function is transformed into another We examine vari ations of the incremental pruning method for solving this problem and compare them to earlier algorithms from theoretical and em pirical perspectives We find that incremen tal pruning is presently the most efficient ex act method for solving POMDPs 1
